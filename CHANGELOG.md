-   Since strings are green, numbers has been changed to pinkish-red
-   Every purple keyword is now good old blue
-   Changed color of variables to plain white, cuz there is too much color already
-   Comments are grey as they should be from beginning
-   Made functions yellow a little bit more vibrant
-   additionally with semantic highlighting, parameters are light blue
